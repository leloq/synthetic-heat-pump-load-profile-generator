# Synthetic Heat Pump Load Profiles
Heatpump.ninja enables the synthetic generation of heat pump load profiles for different geographies and respective temperature profiles for research in energy informatics. The data underlying the project is based on the dataset of Schlemminger et al. [1], who contributed a high-quality dataset of water-to-water heat pump profiles from Hamelin, Northern Germany. The synthetic heat pump profile creation is based on a K-Means clustering approach, described in [2].

This repository serves as open-source publication of the underlying model and shows the evaluation based on 2018 data from [1]. The source code is published under the MIT license.
